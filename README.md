# Welcome to BabySPELL!

BabySPELL offers dividend yield paid automatically in $SPELL.

Just hold $BABYSPELL and you’ll receive $SPELL automatically in your wallet.

## Who are we?
BabySPELL is a community-driven project founded by three young and motivated individuals from different backgrounds. Joe, our Community Manager is trying to become an Influencer in his spare time. Mose, our super Dev, as we like to call him, likes to wrap his head around bubble wrap, hope he’ll be fine! And of course, Elec, our incredible Designer and Web Developer has, fortunately, time for DeFi besides his Ph.D. Program.

## Why did we create BabySPELL?
We created the token to accelerate the idea of bringing passive income into people’s lives. With the idea of ‘Bringing DeFi to the Masses’, we are aiming to build a strong community that offers a profitable and long-term investment for its members.

$BABYSPELL will be deployed on the Fantom Opera Chain. It is one the fastest and cheapest blockchains to use and its adoption has exploded since 2021, especially in decentralized finance (DeFi). It is a secure and fast environment to build decentralized applications. It is fully permissionless and open-source.

Compared to Ethereum for instance, Fantom (FTM) is 300 million times cheaper and 15 to over 300 times faster for transactions. Moreover, when the Ethereum network is congested, the savings when using Fantom become even more enormous.

## What are the tokenomics?
$BABYSPELL has 10% transaction tax. The token contract employs a static rewards system. The 10% transaction tax is split as follows:

· 7% is redistributed $SPELL tokens to holders.

· 2% is used to fuel the liquidity pool.

· 1% is allocated to the marketing wallet.

The dividend mechanism incentivizes token holders to hold to earn dividends from all transactions (e.g., buys and sells).

The dividends are not dependent on the price of either $BABYSPELL or $SPELL. They are based purely on the volume and proportional to the BabySPELL amount you hold in your wallet. The reflections are automatic and come from the 10% transaction tax.

To receive dividends a minimum token balance of 200,000 $BABYSPELL is required to be held in a wallet.

## What about BabySPELL NFTs?
NFTs are one-of-a-kind digital assets, as each one has a unique identifier. They are more common or rarer depending on how the original author mints them, e.g., supply, copies, additional features, etc.

BabySPELL NFTs will be introduced soon (see roadmap). These exclusive sets will be released for a limited time.

## Is BabySPELL SAFU?
The BabySPELL smart contract is a fork of already existing and audited smart contracts. By proving efficiency and full operability, inspiring our source code from these projects gives both confidence in our smart contracts and an extra security layer.

The liquidity pool is locked for 3 months. After that period, the initial liquidity will be used for weekly $BABYSPELL buybacks and burning.

The Buyback & Burn Incentive Program is a new innovative feature that tends to organically add buying pressure on the token. The $BABYSPELL liquidity pool will be used as an instrument to increase the $BABYSPELL price and scarcity.

At the end of the 3 months locking period, 8% will be weekly withdrawn from the $BABYSPELL/$FTM LP. The withdrawn $BABYSPELL will be burned. Part of the withdrawn $FTM will be used to market buy $BABYSPELL (thus creating buying pressure) and burn. More details about this feature will be introduced soon (Follow us on our Socials).
At BabySPELL, we believe in full transparency when it comes to smart contracts. For this reason, we verified and published the source code on FTMScan. Moreover, the source code is publicly available and visible on our official Github page.
